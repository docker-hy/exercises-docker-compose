# Verifies exercise 2.8: a simplified, first pass at putting Nginx in front
# of the project, before exercise 2.9 fixes up every button to work behind
# it. This only checks:
#   - the frontend is reachable simply by going to http://localhost:8000
#   - a direct request to the backend at http://localhost:8000/api/ping
#     works
# The exercise buttons (redis, postgres, messages) may or may not work yet
# behind the proxy at this stage -- that's exercise 2.9's job, checked by
# tests/test_2_09_project_nginx.sh instead.
